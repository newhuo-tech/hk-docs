- ***Specific API***: It introduces the usage, rate limit, request, parameters and response for each API
- **Error Code**: It lists the common error code and the description for this API category
- **FAQ**: It lists the frequently asked questions for this API category

# Quick Start

## Preparation

Before you use API, you need to login the website to create API Key with proper permissions. The API key is shared for all instruments in New Huo Hong Kong including spot, futures, swap, options.

You can manage your API Keys <a href='HTTPS://WWW.nhex.COM.HK/en-us/user/api/'>here</a>.

Every user can create at most 20 API Keys, each can be applied with either permission below:

- Read permission: It is used to query the data, such as order query, trade query.
- Trade permission: It is used to create order, cancel order and transfer, etc.

Please remember below information after creation:

- `Access Key`  It is used in API request
  
- `Secret Key`  It is used to generate the signature (only visible once after creation)

~~~~
The API Key can bind maximum 20 IP addresses (either host IP or network IP), we strongly suggest you bind IP address for security purpose. The API Key without IP binding will be expired after 90 days.
~~~~


~~~~
Warning: These two keys are important to your account safety, please don't share <b>both</b> of them together to anyone else (including any product or person from New Huo). If you find your API Key is disposed, please remove it immediately.
~~~~


## Interface Type

There are two types of interface, you can choose the proper one according to your scenario and preferences.

### REST API

REST (Representational State Transfer) is one of the most popular communication mechanism under HTTP, each URL represents a type of resource.

It is suggested to use Rest API for one-off operation, like trading.

### WebSocket API

WebSocket is a new protocol in HTML5. It is full-duplex between client and server. The connection can be established by a single handshake, and then server can push the notification to client actively.

It is suggest to use WebSocket API to get data update, like market data and order update.

**Authentication**

Both API has two levels of authentication:

Public API: It is for basic information and market data. It doesn't need authentication.

Private API: It is for account related operation like trading and account management. Each private API must be authenticated with API Key.

## Access URLs
You can compare the network latency between two domain <u>api.nhex.com.hk</u> and <u>api-aws.nhex.com.hk</u>, and then choose the better one for you.

In general, the domain <u>api-aws.nhex.com.hk</u> is optimized for AWS client, the latency will be lower.

**REST API**

**`https://api.nhex.com.hk`**  

**Websocket Feed (market data except MBP incremental)**

**`wss://api.nhex.com.hk/ws`**  

**Websocket Feed (market data only MBP incremental)**

**`wss://api.nhex.com.hk/feed`**  

**Websocket Feed (account and order)**

**`wss://api.nhex.com.hk/ws/v2`**  

<aside class="notice">
Please initiate API calls with non-China IP.

## Authentication

### Overview

The API request may be tampered during internet, therefore all private API must be signed by your API Key (Secrete Key).

Each API Key has permission property, please check the API permission, and make sure your API key has proper permission.

A valid request consists of below parts:

- API Path: for example <u>api.nhex.com.hk/v1/order/orders</u>
- API Access Key: The 'Access Key' in your API Key
- Signature Method: The Hash method that is used to sign, it uses **HmacSHA256**
- Signature Version: The version for the signature protocol, it uses **2**
- Timestamp: The UTC time when the request is sent, e.g. 2017-05-11T16:22:06. It is useful to prevent the request to be intercepted by third-party.
- Parameters: Each API Method has a group of parameters, you can refer to detailed document for each of them. 
  - For GET request, all the parameters must be signed.
  - For POST request, the parameters needn't be signed and they should be put in request body.
- Signature: The value after signed, it is guarantee the signature is valid and the request is not be tempered.

### Signature Method

The signature may be different if the request text is different, therefore the request should be normalized before signing. Below signing steps take the order query as an example:

This is a full URL to query one order:

`https://api.nhex.com.hk/v1/order/orders?`

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256`

`&SignatureVersion=2`

`&Timestamp=2021-05-11T15:19:30`

`&order-id=1234567890`

**1. The request Method (GET or POST, WebSocket use GET), append line break “\n”**

`GET`

**2. The host with lower case, append line break “\n”**

Example:
`
api.nhex.com.hk
`

**3. The path, append line break “\n”**

For example, query orders:

`
/v1/order/orders
`



For example, WebSocket v2

`/ws/v2`

**4. The parameters are URL encoded, and ordered based on ASCII**

For example below is the original parameters:

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`order-id=1234567890`

`SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256`

`SignatureVersion=2`

`Timestamp=2021-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

<aside class="notice">
Use UTF-8 encoding and URL encoded, the hex must be upper case. For example, The semicolon ':' should be encoded as '%3A', The space should be encoded as '%20'.
</aside>
<aside class="notice">
The 'timestamp' should be formated as 'YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss' and URL encoded. The value is valid within 5 minutes.
</aside>

Then above parameter should be ordered like below:


`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256`

`SignatureVersion=2`

`Timestamp=2021-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

`order-id=1234567890`

**5. Use char  “&” to concatenate all parameters**


`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2021-05-11T15%3A19%3A30&order-id=1234567890`

**6. Assemble the pre-signed text**

`GET`

`api.nhex.com.hk`

`/v1/order/orders`

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2021-05-11T15%3A19%3A30&order-id=1234567890`


**7. Use the pre-signed text and your Secret Key to generate a signature**

- Use the pre-signed text in step 6 and your API Secret Key to generate hash code by HmacSHA256 hash function.
- Encode the hash code with base-64 to generate the signature.

`4F65x5A2bLyMWVQj3Aqp+B4w+ivaA7n5Oi2SuYtCJ9o=`

**8. Put the signature into request URL**

For Rest interface:

1. Put all the parameters in the URL
2. Encode signature by URL encoding and append in the URL with parameter name “Signature”.

Finally, the request sent to API should be:

`https://api.nhex.com.hk/v1/order/orders?AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx&order-id=1234567890&SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256&SignatureVersion=2&Timestamp=2021-05-11T15%3A19%3A30&Signature=4F65x5A2bLyMWVQj3Aqp%2BB4w%2BivaA7n5Oi2SuYtCJ9o%3D`



For WebSocket interface:

1. Fill the value according to required JSON schema
2. The value in JSON doesn't require URL encode

For example:

`{
    "action": "req", 
    "ch": "auth",
    "params": { 
        "authType":"api",
        "accessKey": "e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx",
        "signatureMethod": "HmacSHA256",
        "signatureVersion": "2.1",
        "timestamp": "2019-09-01T18:16:16",
        "signature": "4F65x5A2bLyMWVQj3Aqp+B4w+ivaA7n5Oi2SuYtCJ9o="
    }
}`

## Sub User

Sub user can be used to isolate the assets and trade, the assets can be transferred between parent and sub users. Sub user can only trade with the sub user. The assets can not be transferred between sub users, only parent user has the transfer permission.  

Sub user has independent login password and API Key, they are managed under parent user in website.

Each parent user can create **200** sub user, each sub user can create at most **20** API Key, each API key can have two permissions: **read** and **trade**.

The sub user API Key can also bind IP address, the expiry policy is the same with parent user.

The sub user can access all public API (including basic information and market data), below are the private APIs that sub user can access:

## Glossary

### Trading symbols

The trading symbols are consist of base currency and quote currency. Take the symbol `BTC/USDT` as an example, `BTC` is the base currency, and `USDT` is the quote currency.  

### Account

The `account-id` defines the Identity for different business type, it can be retrieved from API `/v1/account/accounts` , where the `account-type` is the business types.

## Rate Limiting Rule

Except those endpoints which are marked with new rate limit value separately, following rate limit rules are applicable -
* Each API Key is limited to 10 times per second
* If API Key is empty in request, then each IP is limited to 10 times per second

Endpoints marked with rate limit value separately are applied with new rate limit rule. See "new version rate limit rule" sector of this document.

For example

* Order interface is limited by API Key: no more than 10 times within 1 sec
* Market data interface is limited by IP: no more than 10 times within 1 sec

## Request Format

The API is restful and there are two method: GET and POST.

* GET request: All parameters are included in URL
* POST request: All parameters are formatted as JSON and put int the request body

## Response Format
### Response v1
The response is JSON format.There are four fields in the top level: `status`, `ch`, `ts` and `data`. The first three fields indicate the general status, the business data is is under `data` field.

Below is an example of response:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "ch": "market.btcusdt.kline.1day",
  "ts": 1499223904680,
  "data": // per API response data in nested JSON object
}
```

| Field  | Data Type | Description                                                  |
| ------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| status | string    | Status of API response                                       |
| ch     | string    | The data stream. It may be empty as some API doesn't have data stream |
| ts     | int       | The UTC timestamp when API respond, the unit is millisecond  |
| data   | object    | The body data in response                                    |

### Response v2
For v2, there are three fields in the top level: `code`, `message` and `data`. The first two fields indicate the general status, the business data is is under `data` field.

##  Data Type

The JSON data type described in this document is defined as below:

- `string`: a sequence of characters that are quoted
- `int`: a 32-bit integer, mainly used for status code, size and count
- `long`: a 64-bit integer, mainly used for Id and timestamp
- `float`: a fraction represented in decimal format, mainly used for volume and price, recommend to use high precision decimal data types in program
- `object`: An object, which contains one sub object {}
- `array` : Array, contains multiple objects

## Best Practice

### Security
- It is strongly suggested to bind your IP with your API Key to ensure that your API Key can only be used in your machine. Furthermore, your API Key will be expired after 90 days if it is not binded with any IP.
- It is strongly suggested not to share your API Key with any body or third-party software, otherwise your personal information and asset may be stolen. If your expose your API Key by accident, please do delete the API Key and create a new one.

### General
**API Access**

- It is suggested not to use temporary domain or proxy, which may be not stable.
- It is suggested to use AWS Hong Kong to access API for lower latency


### Market

**Market data**

- It is suggested to use WebSocket interface to subscribe the market update and then cache the data locally, because WebSocket notification has lower latency and not have rate limit.
- It is suggested not to subscribe too many topics in a single websocket connection, it may generate more notifications and cause network latency and disconnection.

**Latest trade**

- It is suggested to subscribe WebSocket topic `market.$symbol.trade.detail`, the response field `price` represents the latest price, and it has lower latency.
- It is suggested to use `tradeId` to de-duplicate if you subscribe WebSocket topic `market.$symbol.trade.detail`.

**Depth**

- It is suggested to subscribe WebSocket topic `market.$symbol.bbo` if you only need the best bid and best offer.
- It is suggested to subscribe WebSocket topic `market.$symbol.depth.$type` if you need multiple bid and offer with normal latency.
- It is suggested to subscribe WebSocket topic `market.$symbol.mbp.$level` if you need multiple bid and offer with lower latency
- It is suggested to use `version` field to de-duplicate and discard the smaller data if you use Rest interface `/market/depth` and WebSocket topic `market.$symbol.depth.$type`. It is suggest to use `seqNum` to de-duplicate and discard the smaller data if yo subscribe WebSocket topic `market.$symbol.mbp.$levels`.

###Order

**Place an order (/v1/order/orders/place)**

- It is suggested to follow the symbol reference (`/v1/common/symbols`) to validate the amount and value before placing the older, otherwise you may place an invalid order and waste your time.
- It is suggested to provide an unique `client-order-id` field when placing the order, it is useful to track your orders status if you fail to get the order id response. Later you can use the `client-order-id` to match the WebSocket order notification or query order detail by interface `/v1/order/orders/getClientOrder`.The uniqueness of the clientOrderId passed in when you place an order will no longer be verified. We recommend you to manage clientOrderId by yourself to ensure its uniqueness. If multiple orders use the same clientOrderId, the latest order corresponding to the clientOrderId will be returned when querying/canceling an order.

**Search history olders (/v1/order/orders)**

- It is recommended to use `start-time` and `end-time` to query, that are two timestamps with 13 digits (millisecond). The maximum query time window is 48 hours (2 days), the more precision you provide, the better performance you will get. You can query for multiple iterations. 

**Order update**

- It is suggested to subscribe WebSocket topic `orders.$symbol.update`, which has lower latency and more accurate sequence.
- It is suggested not to subscribe WebSocket topic `orders.$symbol`,which is replaced by `orders.$symbol.update`, and will be retired later.

###Account

**Asset update**

- It is suggested to subscribe both WebSocket topic `orders.$symbol.update` and `account.update#${mode}`. The former one tells the order status update and arrives earlier than the latter one, and the latter one confirms the final asset balance.
- It is suggested not to subscribe WebSocket topic `accounts`, which is replaced by `accounts.update#${mode}`, and will be retired later.


# Frequently Asked Questions

This section lists the  frequently asked questions regardless the specific API, such as network, signature or common errors.

For specific API question, please check the Error Code and FAQ in each API category.

### Q1：What is UID and account-id?
UID is the unique ID for a user (including master user and sub user), it can be found in Web or App personal information part, or retrieved from API `GET /v2/user/uid`.

The `account-id` defines the identity for different account type under one user, it can be retrieved from API `/v1/account/accounts` , where the `account-type` is the account types.


### Q2：How many API Keys one user can apply?

Every user can create 20 API Keys, and each API Key can be granted with 2 permissions: **read** and **trade**

Each user could create up to 200 sub users, and each sub user could create 20 API Keys, each API key can be granted with 2 permissions: **read** and **trade**.

Below are the explanation for permissions:

1. Read permission: It is used to query data, for example, **query orders**, **query trades**.
2. Trade permission: it is used to **place order**, **cancel order** and **transfer**.


### Q3：Why APIs are always disconnected or timeout?

Please follow below suggestions:

1. It is suggested to invoke API only to host <u>api.nhex.com.hk</u>

### Q4：Why the WebSocket is often disconnected?

Please check below possible reasons:

1. The client didn't respond 'Pong'. It is requird to respond 'Pong' after receive 'Ping' from server.
2. The server didn't receive 'Pong' successfully due to network issue.
3. The connection is broken due to network issue.
4. It is suggested to implement WebSocket re-connect mechanism. If Ping/Pong works well but the connection is broken, the application should be able to re-connect automatically.


### Q5：Why the signature authentication always fail?

Please check whether you follow below rules:

1.The parameter in signature text should be ordered by ASCII, for example below is the original parameters:

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`order-id=1234567890`

`SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256`

`SignatureVersion=2`

`Timestamp=2021-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

They should be ordered like below:

`AccessKeyId=e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx`

`SignatureMethod=HmacSHA256`

`SignatureVersion=2`

`Timestamp=2021-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`

`order-id=1234567890`

2.The signature text should be URL encoded, for example

- The semicolon `:`should be encoded as `%3A`, The space should be encoded as `%20`.
- The timestamp should be formatted as `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss` and after encoded it should be like `2017-05-11T15%3A19%3A30`  

3.The signature should be base64 encoded.

4.The parameter for Get request should be included in signature request.

5.The Timestamp should be UTC time and the format should be YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.

6.The time difference between your timestamp and standard should be less than 1 minute.

7.The message body doesn't need URL encoded if you are using WebSocket for authentication.

8.The host in signature text should be the same as the host in your API request.

The proxy may change the request host, you can try without proxy;

Some http/websocket library may include port in the host, you can try to append port in signature host, like "api.nhex.com.hk:443"


### Q6：Why the API return 'Incorrect Access Key'?

Please check whether Access Key is wrong in URL request, such as:

1. The `AccessKeyId` is not included in URL parameter
2. The length of AccessKey is wrong
3. The AccessKey is already deleted
4. The URL request is not assembled correctly which cause AccessKey is parsed unexpected in server side.

### Q7：Why the API return 'gateway-internal-error'?

Please check below possible reasons:

1. It may be due to network issue or server internal error, please try again later.
2. The data format should be correct (standard JSON).
3. The `Content-Type` in POST header should be `application/json` .

### Q8：Why the API return 'login-required'?

Please check below possible reasons:

1. The URL request parameter should include `AccessKeyId`.
2. The URL request parameter should include `Signature`.

### Q9: Why the API return HTTP 405 'method-not-allowed'?

It indicates the request path doesn't exist, please check the path spelling carefully. Due to the Nginx setting, the request path is case sensitive, please follow the path definition in document.

# Trading

## Introduction

Trading APIs provide trading related functionality, including placing order, canceling order, order history query, trading history query, transaction fee query.

<aside class="notice">All endpoints in this section require authentication</aside>
<aside class="warning">The parameter "account-id" and "source" should be set properly, refer to details in Request Parameters description below.</aside>

Below is the glossary of trading related field:

**order type**: The order type is consist of trade direction and behavior type: [direction]-[type]

direction:

- buy
- sell

type:

- market : The price is not required in order creation request, you only need to specify either volume or amount. The matching and trade will happen automatically according to the request.
- limit: Both of the price and amount should be specified in order creation request.
- limit-maker: The price is specified in order creation request as market maker. It will not be matched in the matching queue.
- ioc: ioc stands for "immediately or cancel", it means the order will be canceled if it couldn't be matched. If the order is partially traded, the remaining part will be canceled.
- limit-fok: fok stands for "fill or kill", it means the order will be cancelled if it couldn't be **fully** matched. Even if the order can be partially filled, the entire order will be cancelled.
- market-grid: Grid trading market order (not supported by API)
- limit-grid: Grid trading limit order (not supported by API)
- stop-limit: The price in order creation request is the trigger price. The order will be put into matching queue only when the market price reaches the trigger price. This type is replaced by conditional order, please use conditional order APIs

**order source**: the origin of the order

- spot-api: API order from spot account

**order state**:

- created: The order is created, and not in the matching queue yet.
- submitted: The order is submitted, and already in the matching queue, waiting for deal.
- partial-filled: The order is already in the matching queue and partially traded, and is waiting for further matching and trade.
- filled: The order is already traded and not in the matching queue any more.
- partial-canceled: The order is not in the matching queue any more. The status is transferred from 'partial-filled', the order is partially trade, but remaining is canceled.
- canceling: The order is under canceling, but haven't been removed from matching queue yet.
- canceled: The order is not in the matching queue any more, and completely canceled. There is no trade associated with this order.

**IDs**: The frequently used identities are listed below:

- order-id: The unique identity for order.
- client-order-id: The identity defined by the client. This id is included in order creation request, and will be returned as order-id. For completed orders, clientOrderId will be valid for 2 hours since the order creation (it is still valid for 8 hours concerning other orders). That is to say, if an order has been created for more than 2 hours, clientOrderId can’t be used to query the completed order (It is recommended to check it with orderid). Among them, the status of the completed order includes partially canceled, canceled, and fully executed. The allowed characters are letters (case sensitive), digit, underscore (_) and hyphen (-), no more than 64 chars.
- match-id : The identity for order matching.
- trade-id : The unique identity for the trade.

## FAQ

### Q1：What is client-order-id?
A： The `client-order-id` is an optional request parameter while placing order. It's string type which maximum length is 64. The client order id is generated by client, and is only valid within 8 hours (It’s only valid within 2 hours for the final state).

### Q2：How to get the order size, price and decimal precision?
A： You can call API `GET /v1/common/symbols` to get the currency pair information, pay attention to the difference between the minimum amount and the minimum price.   

Below are common errors:

- order-value-min-error: The order price is less than minimum price
- order-orderprice-precision-error : The precision for limited order price is wrong 
- order-orderamount-precision-error : The precision for limited order amount is wrong
- order-limitorder-price-max-error : The limited order price is higher than the threshold
- order-limitorder-price-min-error : The limited order price is lower than the threshold
- order-limitorder-amount-max-error : The limited order amount is larger than the threshold
- order-limitorder-amount-min-error : The limited order amount is smaller than the threshold  

### Q3：Why I got insufficient balance error while placing an order just after a successful order matching?
A：To ensure the low latency of order update, Order update push is made directly after order matching. Meanwhile, the clearing service of that order may be still in progress at backend. It is suggested to follow either of below to ensure a successful order submission:

1、Subscribe to WebSocket topic `accounts` for getting account balance moves to ensure the completion of asset clearing.

2、After receiving WebSocket push message, check account balance from REST endpoint to ensure sufficient available balance for the next order submission.

3、Leave sufficient balance in your account.

### Q4: What is the difference between 'filled-fees' and 'filled-points' in match result?
A: Transaction fee can be paid from either of below. They won't exist at the same time.

1、filled-fees: Filled-fee is also called transaction fee. It's charged from your income currency from the transaction. For example, if your purchase order of BTC/USDT got matched，the transaction fee will be based on BTC.

2、filled-points: If user enabled transaction fee deduction, the fee should be charged from either HT or Point. When there's sufficient fund in HT/Point, filled-fees is empty while filled-points has value. That means the deduction is made via HT/Point. User could refer to field `fee-deduct-currency` to get the exact deduction type of the transaction. 

### Q5: What is the difference between 'match-id' and 'trade-id' in matching result?
A: The `match-id` is the identity for order matching, while the `trade-id` is the unique identifier for each trade. One `match-id` may be correlated with multiple `trade-id`, or no `trade-id`(if the order is cancelled). For example, if a taker's order got matched with 3 maker's orders at the same time, it generates 3 trade IDs but only one match ID.

### Q6: Why the order submission could be rejected even though the order price is set as same as current best bid (or best ask)?
A: For some extreme illiquid trading symbols, the best quote price at particular time might be far away from last trade price. But the price limit is actually based on last trade price which could possibly exclude best quote price from valid range for any new order. It is suggested to place orders based on the WebSocket pushed Bid and market data.



# Conditional Order

## Introduction

By comparing with the existing stop limit order, the newly introduced conditional order does have following major differences:<br>

1)	Although the newly introduced conditional order is also triggered by stop price, before it being triggered, the Exchange will not lock order margin for this order. Only when this conditional order being successfully triggered, its order margin will be locked.<br>
2)	Conditional order does support not only limit order type but also market order type. <br>


<aside class="notice">All endpoints in this section require authentication</aside>

## Place a conditional order

POST /v2/algo-orders<br>
API Key Permission: Trade<br>
Rate Limit (NEW): 20times/2sec<br>
Conditional order can be only placed via this endpoint instead of any endpoint in "Trading" section.<br>

### Request Parameter
|	Field	|	Data Type	|	Mandatory	|	Default Value|	Description	|	Valid Value	|
|	-----	|	-----	|	------	|	----	|	------	|	----	|
|	accountId	|	integer	|	TRUE	|		|	Account ID	|At present only support spot account id		|
|	symbol	|	string	|	TRUE	|		|	Trading symbol	|		|
|	orderPrice	|	string	|	FALSE	|		|	Order price (invalid for market order) 	|		|
|	orderSide	|	string	|	TRUE	|		|	Order side	|	buy,sell	|
|	orderSize	|	string	|	FALSE	|		|	Order size (invalid for market buy order) 	|		|
|	orderValue	|	string	|	FALSE	|		|	Order value (only valid for market buy order) 	|		|
|	timeInForce	|	string	|	FALSE	|	gtc for orderType=limit; ioc for orderType=market	|	Time in force	|	gtc (invalid for orderType=market), boc (invalid for orderType=market), ioc, fok (invalid for orderType=market)	|
|	orderType	|	string	|	TRUE	|		|	Order type	|	limit,market	|
|	clientOrderId	|	string	|	TRUE	|		|	Client order ID (max length 64-char) 	|		|
|	stopPrice	|	string	|	TRUE	|		|	Stop price	|		|
|	trailingRate	|	string	|	FALSE	|		|	Trailing rate (only valid for trailing stop order)	|	[0.001,0.050]	|

Note:<br>
•	The gap between orderPrice and stopPrice shouldn't exceed the price limit ratio. For example, a limit buy order's price couldn't be higher than 110% of market price, this limitation should be also applicable to orderPrice/stopPrice ratio.<br>
•	User has to make sure the clientOrderId's uniqueness. While the conditional order being triggered, if the clientOrderId is duplicated with another order (within 24hour) coming from same user, the conditional order will fail triggering.<br>
•	User has to make sure the corresponding account has sufficient fund for triggering this conditional order, otherwise it would cause conditional order triggering failure.<br>
•	timeInForce enum values: gtc - good till cancel，boc - book or cancel (also called as post only, or book only), ioc - immediate or cancel, fok - fill or kill<br>

# Websocket Market Data

## Introduction

### Websocket URL

**Websocket Market Feed (excluding MBP incremental channel & its REQ channel)**

**`wss://api.nhex.com.hk/ws`**


**MBP incremental channel & its REQ channel)**

**`wss://api.nhex.com.hk/feed`**


### Data Format

All return data of websocket Market APIs are compressed with GZIP so they need to be unzipped.

### Heartbeat and Connection

```json
{"ping": 1492420473027} 
```
After connected to New Huo Hong Kong's Websocket server, the server will send heartbeat periodically (currently at 5s interval). The heartbeat message will have an integer in it, e.g.

```json
{"pong": 1492420473027} 
```
When client receives this heartbeat message, it should respond with a matching "pong" message which has the same integer in it, e.g.

<aside class="warning">After the server sent two consecutive heartbeat messages without receiving at least one matching "pong" response from a client, then right before server sends the next "ping" heartbeat, the server will be disconnected with the client server.</aside>

### Subscribe to Topic

> Sub request:

```json
{
  "sub": "market.btcusdt.kline.1min",
  "id": "id1"
}
```

To receive data you have to send a "sub" message first.

{
  "sub": "topic to sub",
  "id": "id generate by client"
}

> Sub response:

```json
{
  "id": "id1",
  "status": "ok",
  "subbed": "market.btcusdt.kline.1min",
  "ts": 1489474081631
}
```

After successfully subscribed, you will receive a response to confirm subscription

Then, you will received messages when there is any update in the subcribed topics.

### Unsubscribe

> UnSub request:

```json
{
  "unsub": "market.btcusdt.trade.detail",
  "id": "id4"
}
```

To unsubscribe, you need to send below message

{
  "unsub": "topic to unsub",
  "id": "id generate by client"
}

> UnSub response:

```json
{
  "id": "id4",
  "status": "ok",
  "unsubbed": "market.btcusdt.trade.detail",
  "ts": 1494326028889
}
```

And you will receive a message to confirm the action.

### Pull Data

While connected to websocket, you can also use it in pull style by sending message to the server.

To request pull style data, you send below message

{
  "req": "topic to req",
  "id": "id generate by client"
}

You will receive a response accordingly and immediately

### Rate Limit

**Rate limt of pull style query (req)**

The limitation of single connection is 100 ms.

## Market By Price (incremental update)

User could subscribe to this channel to receive incremental update of Market By Price order book. Refresh message, the full image of the order book, are acquirable from the same channel, upon "req" request.

**MBP incremental channel & its REQ channel)**

**`wss://api.nhex.com.hk/feed`**


Suggested downstream data processing:<br>
1)	Subscribe to incremental updates and start to cache them;<br>
2)	Request refresh message (with same number of levels), and base on its “seqNum” to align it with the cached incremental message which has the same “prevSeqNum”;<br>
3)	Start to continuously process incremental messages to build up MBP book;<br>
4)	The “prevSeqNum” of the current incremental message must be the same with “seqNum” of the previous message, otherwise it implicates message loss which should require another round of refresh message retrieval and alignment;<br>
5)	Once received a new price level from incremental message, that price level should be inserted into appropriate position of existing MBP book;<br>
6)	Once received an updated “size” at the existing price level from incremental message, the size should be replaced directly by the new value;<br>
7)	Once received a “size=0” at existing price level from incremental message, that price level should be removed from MBP book;<br>
8)	If one incremental message includes updates of multiple price levels, all of those levels should be updated simultaneously in MBP book.<br>

Currently New Huo Hong Kong Global only supports 5-level/20-level MBP incremental channel and 150-level incremental channel, the differences between them are -<br>
1) Different depth of market.<br>
2) 5-level/20-level incremental MBP is a tick by tick feed, which means whenever there is an order book change at that level, it pushes an update; 150 levels incremental MBP feed is based on the gap between two snapshots at 100ms interval.<br>
3) While there is single side order book update, either bid or ask, the incremental message sent from 5-level/20-level MBP feed only contains that side update. <br>

```json
{
    "ch": "market.btcusdt.mbp.5",
    "ts": 1573199608679,
    "tick": {
        "seqNum": 100020146795,
        "prevSeqNum": 100020146794,
        "asks": [
            [645.140000000000000000, 26.755973959140651643]
        ]
    }
}
```
But the incremental message from 150 levels MBP feed contains not only that side update and also a blank object for another side.

```json
{
    "ch":"market.btcusdt.mbp.150",
    "ts":1573199608679,
    "tick":{
        "seqNum":100020146795,
        "prevSeqNum":100020146794,
        "bids":[ ],
        "asks":[
            [645.14,26.75597395914065]
        ]
    }
}
```
In the near future, New Huo Hong Kong Global will align the update behavior of 150-level incremental channel with 5-level/20-level, which means while single side order book changed (either bid or ask), the update message will be no longer including a blank object for another side.<br>
4) While there is nothing change between two snapshots in past 100ms, the 150 levels incremental MBP feed still sends out a message which contains two blank objects – bids & asks. <br>

```json
{
    "ch":"market.zecusdt.mbp.150",
    "ts":1585074391470,
    "tick":{
        "seqNum":100772868478,
        "prevSeqNum":100772868476,
        "bids":[  ],
        "asks":[  ]
    }
}
```
But 5-level/20-level incremental channel won’t disseminate any update in such a case.<br>
In the future, New Huo Hong Kong Global will align the update behavior of 150-level incremental channel with 5-level/20-level, which means while there is no order book change at all, the channel will be no longer disseminating messages of blank object any more.<br>
5) 5-level/20-level incremental channel only supports the following symbols at this stage - btcusdt,ethusdt while 150-level incremental channel supports all symbols.<br>

REQ channel supports refreshing message for 5-level, 20-level, and 150-level.

# Websocket Account and Order

## Introduction

### Access URL

**Websocket Asset and Order**

**`wss://api.nhex.com.hk/ws/v2`**  


### Message Compression

Unlike Market WebSocket, the return data of Account and Order Websocket are not compressed by GZIP.

### Heartbeat

```json
{
	"action": "ping",
	"data": {
		"ts": 1575537778295
	}
}
```

Once the Websocket connection is established, New Huo Hong Kong server will periodically send "ping" message at 20s interval, with an integer inside.

```json
{
    "action": "pong",
    "data": {
          "ts": 1575537778295 // the same with "ping" message
    }
}
```

Once client receives "ping", it should respond "pong" message back with the same integer.

### Valid Values of `action`

| Valid Values | Description                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| sub          | Subscribe                                   |
| req          | Request                                     |
| ping,pong    | Heartbeat                                   |
| push         | Push (from New Huo Hong Kong server to client's server) |

### Rate Limit

There are multiple limitations for this version:

- The limitation of single connection for **valid** request (including req, sub, unsub, excluding ping/pong or other invalid request) is **50 per second**. It will return "too many request" when the limit is exceeded.
- A single API Key can establish **10** connections. It will return "too many connection" when the limit is exceeded.
- The limitation of requests from single IP is **100 per second**. It will return "too many request" when the limitation is exceeded.

### Authentication

Authentication request field list

| Field            | Mandatory | Data Type | Description                                                  |
| ---------------- | --------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| action           | true      | string    | Action type, valid value: "req"                              |
| ch               | true      | string    | Channel, valid value: "auth"                                 |
| authType         | true      | string    | Authentication type, valid value: "api". Note: this is not part of signature calculation |
| accessKey        | true      | string    | Access key                                                   |
| signatureMethod  | true      | string    | Signature method, valid value: "HmacSHA256"                  |
| signatureVersion | true      | string    | Signature version, valid value: "2.1"                        |
| timestamp        | true      | string    | Timestamp in UTC in format like 2017-05-11T16:22:06          |
| signature        | true      | string    | Signature                                                    |

```json
{
    "action": "req", 
    "ch": "auth",
    "params": { 
        "authType":"api",
        "accessKey": "e2xxxxxx-99xxxxxx-84xxxxxx-7xxxx",
        "signatureMethod": "HmacSHA256",
        "signatureVersion": "2.1",
        "timestamp": "2019-09-01T18:16:16",
        "signature": "4F65x5A2bLyMWVQj3Aqp+B4w+ivaA7n5Oi2SuYtCJ9o="
    }
}
```

This is an exmaple of authentication request:

```json
{
	"action": "req",
	"code": 200,
	"ch": "auth",
	"data": {}
}
```

The response of success:

### Generating Signature 

The signature generation method of Account and Order WebSocket is similar with Rest API , with only following differences:

1. The request method should be "GET", to URL "/ws/v2".
2. The involved field names in signature generation are: accessKey，signatureMethod，signatureVersion，timestamp
3. The valid value of signatureVersion is 2.1.

```
GET\n
api.nhex.com.hk\n
/ws/v2\n
accessKey=0664b695-rfhfg2mkl3-abbf6c5d-49810&signatureMethod=HmacSHA256&signatureVersion=2.1&timestamp=2019-12-05T11%3A53%3A03
```

The final string involved in signature generation should be like below:

Note: The data in JSON request doesn't require URL encode

### Subscribe a Topic to Continuously Receive Updates

> Sub request:

```json
{
	"action": "sub",
	"ch": "accounts.update"
}
```

Once the Websocket connection is established, Websocket client could send following request to subscribe a topic:

> Sub respose:

```json
{
	"action": "sub",
	"code": 200,
	"ch": "accounts.update#0",
	"data": {}
}
```

Upon success, Websocket client should receive a response below:

## Subscribe Order Updates

API Key Permission: Read

An order update can be triggered by any of following:<br>
-	Conditional order triggering failure (eventType=trigger)<br>
-	Conditional order cancellation before trigger (eventType=deletion)<br>
-	Order creation (eventType=creation)<br>
-	Order matching (eventType=trade)<br>
-	Order cancellation (eventType=cancellation)<br>

The field list in order update message can be various per event type, developers can design the data structure in either of two ways:<br>
- Define a data structure including fields for all event types, allowing a few of them are null<br>
- Define different data structure for each event type to include specific fields, inheriting from a common data structure which has common fields

## Subscribe Trade Details & Order Cancellation post Clearing

API Key Permission: Read

Only update when order is in transaction or cancellation. Order transaction update is in tick by tick mode, which means, if a taker’s order matches with multiple maker’s orders, the simultaneous multiple trades will be disseminated one by one. But the update sequence of the multiple trades, may not be exactly the same as the sequence of the transactions made. Also, if an order is auto cancelled immediately just after its partial fills, for example a typical IOC order, this channel would possibly disseminate the cancellation update first prior to the trade. <br>

If user willing to receive order updates in exact same sequence with the original happening, it is recommended to subscribe order update channel orders#${symbol}.<br>
